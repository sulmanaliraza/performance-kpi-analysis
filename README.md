# Performance KPI Analysis (Python + SQL)

## Business Problem
Service organisations need reliable performance reporting to identify trends, track KPIs, and ensure services are delivered efficiently and in line with contractual / SLA expectations.

## Objective
Analyse performance data to:
- Identify trends and improvement opportunities
- Monitor progress against KPIs and SLA-style targets
- Provide clear, actionable insights for stakeholders

## Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas) for analysis and reporting logic  
- **SQL** for KPI queries and compliance reporting  
- Dataset: sample service performance metrics (Health & Education style service lines)

## What’s Inside This Repo
- `data/` – sample KPI dataset  
- `sql/` – KPI queries, trend reporting, compliance metrics  
- `notebooks/` – Python analysis script (convertible to a notebook)  
- `reports/` – space for charts/screenshots/outputs

## Key KPI Examples
- Incident volume trend analysis
- Response and resolution time monitoring
- SLA compliance rate (response & resolution)
- Simple outlier detection (explainable rules)

## How To Run (Python)
1. Install Python 3.10+  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
