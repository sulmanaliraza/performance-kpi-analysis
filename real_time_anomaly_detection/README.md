# Real-Time KPI Anomaly Detection Framework (Python)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time analytics framework designed
to detect abnormal KPI behaviour and support proactive performance
management.

## Business Problem
Operational teams need early warning signals when KPIs deviate from
normal behaviour so that issues can be investigated before service
quality is impacted.

## Approach
- Establish baseline performance metrics by service line
- Apply statistical thresholds to identify abnormal KPI behaviour
- Flag anomalies in near real-time using explainable rules

## Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas)
- Statistical baseline analysis
- Rule-based anomaly detection (AI/ML-ready design)

## AI / ML Readiness
This framework is intentionally designed to be extended with:
- Time-series forecasting models
- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Predictive performance analytics

## Outcome
Demonstrates how data analytics can support early issue detection,
continuous improvement, and data-driven operational decisions.
